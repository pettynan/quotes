Project by Peter Tynan and Anthony Berry

## Instructions for Running Code
To run code, cd into top level of Quotes directory and run "./gradlew run" in the command line. You should see a random Star Wars quote (with its author!) returned in the command line!! If the connection to the web fails, you will see a random non-Star Wars quote taken from the local database instead.
